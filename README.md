# To-Do-List
# What IS This Code?
# This program is designed to help make changes to their To-Do List. These changes include
# adding items, deleting items, checking items off, and much more. These changes are all listed by numbers 
# in a menu you will see pop up at the start. 


# What happens when you run?
# When you hit run on the program you will see a menu with options to choose from.
# From there you will type and enter a number depending on what you want the progam to do with your list.
# After choosing, the change will be made to your list and from there you can choose whether you want to 
# make another change to the list, view the list, or end the program as a whole.
